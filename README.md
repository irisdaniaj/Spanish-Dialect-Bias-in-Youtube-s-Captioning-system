# Spanish Dialect Bias in Youtube's Captioning system
This repository contain my final project for the Advanced Method in Social Science class at the Univerisity of Munich. 

TODO: 
- [ ] Think if it is best to upload everything together or separate: I think separate it's better because if i keep them separate i can preserve the id as name and then i can find the correspoing right traslation like this. 
- [ ] do i need to clean the data? 
- [ ] Upload stuff to youtube and get the captions
- [ ] Donwload the captions
- [ ] compare them to the trascript
- [ ] which metric to use?
- [ ] think of nice comparison and visualization(male vs female) --> how do i keep track of the females and male texts?
- [ ] maybe think if to use some metric from the class
- [ ] Nice repo(title, nice description)
