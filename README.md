# Spanish Dialect Bias in Youtube's Captioning system
This repository contain my final project for the Advanced Method in Social Science class at the Univerisity of Munich. 

TODO: 
- [ ] I tried to upload them separely but I did exceed the daily Youtube's API quotas of videos that I can upload in a day, so I have created a one big .wav file with all the audios divided per gender together.
- [ ] The problem now is to modify the script to handle to spanish gender audios because they are not so nicely divided in gender.
- [ ] wtf are the .mp4 and why are they not ignored? 
- [ ] Also create nice command line executable script 
- [ ] do i need to clean the data? 
- [ ] Upload stuff to youtube and get the captions
- [ ] Donwload the captions
- [ ] compare them to the trascript
- [ ] which metric to use?
- [ ] think of nice comparison and visualization(male vs female) --> how do i keep track of the females and male texts?
- [ ] maybe think if to use some metric from the class
- [ ] Nice repo(title, nice description)
